# Cars-and-their-Bodystyles
 The code facilitates scraping car data from a website. It leverages the requests library to download webpages containing car listings. Once downloaded, BeautifulSoup parses the HTML structure, allowing the code to pinpoint relevant data elements. The code also handles pagination if the website has multiple pages of car listings.

# Functionality

* Fetches car listings from a designated website (website URL specified in the code).
* Parses the HTML structure of each listing page using BeautifulSoup.
* The code can be modified to extract specific car details like names, production years, number of doors, and body styles.
* The code can be extended to handle pagination and scrape data from multiple listing pages if applicable.

**Technical Stack:**

* Python 3 (version not specified, but check code compatibility)
* Requests library (for downloading webpages)
* BeautifulSoup library (for parsing HTML)

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries (`requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) installed. You can install them using `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
3. **(Optional, if data storage is implemented)** Modify the code to specify your desired data storage location (e.g., file path or database connection details).
4. Run the Python script (script name to be specified based on your file structure).

**Note:**

* This is a basic example for educational purposes.
* The code for extracting specific car details and handling pagination is not included here for brevity. You can modify the code to suit your needs.
